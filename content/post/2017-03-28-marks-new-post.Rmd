#This is the title

And this is the part that people will see when they click into your post

Let's import some data
```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
suppressMessages(library(knitr))

```

```{r kable, echo = FALSE}
data = mtcars
kable(head(data))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth()

```

```{python}
for i in range(1, 10):
  if i > 5:
    break
```
